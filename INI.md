# INI

Getting Started
----



### introduction

- INI is a configuration file with a fixed standard format
- Base elements are keys or properties
- Each key consists of a `name` and a `value`, separated by an equal sign (`=`)
- `key name` is displayed to the `left side` of the equals sign
- `equal sign` and `semicolon` are `reserved` characters
- INI configuration method comes from the MS-DOS operating system

Now an informal standard for many configurations, other operating systems may use `.conf` or `.cfg` as a suffix


### Example


```ini
; Here are the comments
[owner]
name=John Doe
organization=Acme Products

[database]
; Here are the comments
server=192.0.2.42
port=143
file="acme payroll.dat"

[section.subsection]
foo = bar
```




### Comments

comment (`;`)

```ini
; This is the comment text and will be ignored
```

comment (`#`)
```ini
# Here is the comment text, ‚ö†Ô∏è Some compilers support it
```

Comments after a line (`;`,`#`) _(not standard)_

```ini
var = a ; this is an inline comment
foo = bar # this is another inline comment
```

Comments must appear alone on lines in some cases



### Sections

- The name appears on a line by itself
- Names are enclosed in square brackets `[` and `]`
- No explicit `section end` delimiter
- End at the next `section` declaration or at the end of the file
- Section and attribute names are case insensitive
<!--rehype:className=style-round-->

```ini
[section]
key1 = a
key2 = b
```

The same as `JSON` below üëá

```json
{
  "section": {
    "key1": "a",
    "key2": "b"
  }
}
```



### Nesting (supported by some parsers)

```ini
[section]
domain = quickref.me
[section.subsection]
foo = bar
```

The same as `JSON` below üëá

```js
{
  "section": {
    "domain": "quickref.me"
    "subsection": {
      "foo": "bar"
    }
  }
}
```

Nest to previous section (shorthand)

```ini
[section]
domain = quickref.me
[.subsection]
foo = bar
```



### Escape character

sequence | meaning
:-| :-
`\\` | \ (single backslash, escape escape character)
`\'` | apostrophe
`\"` | double quotes
`\0` | null character
`\a` | ringtone/alert/sound
`\b` | Backspace, [Bell character] for some applications (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_character)
`\t` | tab character
`\r` | carriage return
`\n` | newline
`\;` | semicolon
`\#` | number sign
`\=` | equal sign
`\:` | colon
`\x????` | Unicode character for the hexadecimal code point corresponding to ????



### Array

```ini
[section]
domain = quickref.me
array[]=first value
array[]=second value
```

The same as `JSON` below üëá

```js
{
    "section": {
        "domain": "quickref.me",
            "array": [
            "first value",
            "second value"
        ]
    }
}
```
